            <h2>Learning CSS3 Selectors - "The Basics"</h2>

                <p>To apply CSS to an element you need to select it. CSS provides you with a number of different ways
                    to do this, and you can explore them in this module.
                <br>
                    All HTML tags have styles associated with them.
                </p>
                <p>Using a class selector gives you the ability to setup an independent style that you can then apply to any HTML tag.
                <br>
                    Unlike an HTML selector, which automatically targets a specific tag, a class is given a unique name that is then specified using the style attribute in the HTML tag or tags you want to use it in.
                <br>
                <p>For example:</p>    
                
                    <i>"p.authorName { font-size: 1em }"</i>
                </p>
                <style>
                h3 {color:crimson; font-style: oblique;}
                </style>
                <h3>To define an HTML selector:</h3>
                <ol>     
                        <li>Start with the HTML selector whose properties you want to define.</li>
                        <li>Add a curly bracket to open the rule.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to always close the declaration list with a curly bracket.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>To define a class selector:</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Type a period (.) and a class name.</li>
                        <li>Open and close a declaration block with curly brackets.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Attribute Selectors"</h2>
                
                <p>You can look for elements that have a certain HTML attribute, or have a certain value for an HTML attribute, using the <i>attribute selector</i>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Instruct CSS to look for attributes by wrapping the selector with square brackets ([])</li>
                            "[ data-type='primary'] { color:blue; }"
                        
                        <li>This CSS looks for all elements that have an attribute of data-type with a value of primary like this:</li>
                        <span>"'< div >' [ data-type='primary'] "< /div ></span>
                    </ol>

            <h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Action PseudoClass Selectors"</h2>

                <p>HTML element find themselves in various state, either because they are interacted with, or one of the their child elements is in a certain state. </p>

                <p>For example, an HTML element could hovered with the mouse pointer by a user or a child element could also be hovered by the user. For those situations, use the :hover pseudo-class.</p>

                <h3>Pseudo-element #</h3>

                    <p>Pseudo-element differ from pseudo-classes instead of responding to the platform state, they act as if they are inserting a new element with CSS.
                        Pseudo-elements are also syntatically different from pseudo-classes, because instead of using single colon (:), we use a double colon (::)

            <h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Combinators Selectors"</h2>

            <p>A combinator is what sits between two selectors. For example, if the selector was p> strong, the combinator is the
                > character. The selectors which use these combinators help you select items based on their psotiion in the document.

                <h3>Descendant combinator #</h3>

                    <p>To understand descendant combinators, you need to first understand parent and child elements.</p>
                    
                    &ltp&gt A paragraph of text of some <strong> bold text for emphasis</strong> &ltp&gt

                    <p>The parent element is the &ltp&gt which contains text. Inside that &ltp&gt element is a &ltstrong&gt element,
                        making its content bold. Because it is inside the &ltp&gt, it is a child element <a href="#">read more</a>
