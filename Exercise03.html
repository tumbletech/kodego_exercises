        <p>About a fourth of the country's total population is overweight and obese
        and the number is projected to further increase by the end of the decade, particularly
        among Filipino adolescents. That risk is heightened by the unregulated access of young
        students to sweetened drinks and junk food, which could later cause delibitating
        illnesses like hearth disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer - among the leading
        causes of death in the country.</p>
